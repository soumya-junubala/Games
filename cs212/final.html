  <!-- Addendum explaining the code -->
  <div class="addendum">
    <h2>Addendum:</h2>
    <h3>Development Process:</h3>
<p>
  The process of creating "Lights Out" was methodical, using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to make the game functional. The idea was to create a visually appealing and dynamic game where players could click on cells to switch them off, making for a compelling and different kind of gameplay.
</p>

<h3>Creative Choices:</h3>
<p>
 To guarantee a tidy and well-organized design, I used a flex container with a column arrangement in the middle. The background, which is only a placeholder image, improves the overall visual of the gaming area by bringing in some ambiance.
</p>
<p>
  JavaScript is used to create the game board, which is represented by a grid of cells, dynamically. CSS styles determine how each cell looks, resulting in a grid layout that complements the intended game aesthetic. To improve the user experience, the cells' active and inactive states are graphically distinguished.
</p>

<h3>Challenges Faced:</h3>
<p>
  For every gaming session, a randomly generated solvable board is generated by the JavaScript logic to add a challenge element. By manipulating the states of cells and their neighbors, this process generates a puzzle that players must solve. The restart button gives the game more replay value by enabling the creation of fresh, original puzzles.
</p>
<p>
  There were difficulties in making sure the random boards could be solved and in striking a balance between playability and difficulty. To address these issues, great thought was devoted to the toggleCell function, which effectively modifies the states of cells and their surrounding areas, guaranteeing a puzzle that can be solved each time.
</p>

<h3>Insights Gained:</h3>
<p>
  During the process, new perspectives on the interplay among HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were obtained, demonstrating the potential of these technologies to produce dynamic web pages. The fusion of creativity and problem-solving skills was essential in optimizing the design and functionality of the game.
</p>
<p>
  In conclusion, the game Lights Out is a monument to the perfect fusion of design and programming. The procedure comprised strategic decisions about structure, style, and functionality as well as overcoming obstacles to provide an entertaining and demanding gaming experience. The knowledge acquired advances our comprehension of web development and the harmonious coexistence of front-end technologies.
